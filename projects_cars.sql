/*

Question #1: Which products should we order more of or less of?

This question refers to inventory reports, including low stock and product performance.
This will optimize the supply and the user experience by preventing the best-selling products from going out-of-stock.

- The low stock represents the quantity of each product sold divided by the quantity of product in stock.
  We can consider the ten lowest rates. These will be the top ten products that are (almost) out-of-stock.
- The product performance represents the sum of sales per product.
- Priority products for restocking are those with high product performance that are on the brink of being out of stock.
